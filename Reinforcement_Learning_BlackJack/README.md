## Blackjack with QLearning 

This folder contains the code for a project were my team and I were tasked with applying QLearning to blackjack, aiming to get it to learn a close to optimal strategy.

The code for this can be found under coursework -> Code -> BlackJack_QLearning.py.
There are two notebooks that were used to create visualisations of the strategy these are found in coursework -> Code.

The tracking folder has not been included as the files are too large.
