## Autonomous Agent Behaviour Design

In this project I designed a "beach cleaning robot team". In this simulation the beach in covered in rubbish and a team of robot has to go around collecting the rubbish and emptying it into bins. Each robot has different functionality, the small robots collect the small bits and the large robots collect the large bits. 

- To see a further indepth explaination of this please read solutions.md. 
- If you would like to run this simulation please run the run.py file. 
- The source code is all located within the src folder. 
- An analysis of the results can be found in system_analysis.ipynb
